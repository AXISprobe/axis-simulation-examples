1_simput_low.bash, 1_simput_med.bash and 1_simput_hi.bash creates simput files for etaCarinae images taken at 0.5–1.2 keV (low), 1.2–2.0 keV (med), and 2.0–7.0 keV (high) respectively.

Here's the link to download these input images - http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/openFITS/xray_data.html. There are also other input images which can be simulated same as etaCarinae for this example.

2_simputmerge.bash -- To merge these generated simput files

3_sixtesim.bash -- Uses the sixtesim tool to simulate etaCarinae extended source.

4_ftmerge.bash -- Combines the output event files of all 4 chips generated by sixtesim tool.

5_imgev.bash -- Uses SIXTE imgev tool to create image file. It can be seen in, e.g., ds9.

6_attgen_dither.bash -- Generates an attitude file with Lissajous pattern around the given source. ( see section 10.4.4 of SIXTE manual)

7_exposure_map.bash -- generates a exposure map (see section 10.4.4 of SIXTE manual)

8_dither_sixtesim.bash -- re-runs sixtesim based on attitude file and provides a image file with chips gaps filled.

master_script -- Runs all above scripts in backgroud at once. NOTE: For longer exposure time it could take some time.
